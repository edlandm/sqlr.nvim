# Sqlr - SQL Runner

This plugin allows you to run SQL queries against a database and view the
results in a split window.

Currently tested with MS SQL Server (using sqlcmd) and Oracle Database 19c
(using sqlplus), as those are my use-cases. I'd like to add support for other
databases such as sqlite, duckdb, and posgresql, but those aren't ones I use
on a daily basis so they're lower priority at the moment.

Code is provided as is. This is a tool for me and my workflow. If it helps or
inspires you, that's great. If it doesn't work for you, you can fork the repo.
You can make a PR and I'll look at it, but I reserve the right to reject for
any reason.
