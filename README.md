# Sqlr - SQL Runner

This plugin acts as a client to my other project,
[sqlrepl](https://github.com/edlandm/sqlrepl) which allows you to run SQL
queries against a database and view the results in a split window.

Currently tested with MS SQL Server and Oracle Database 19c, as those are my
current use-cases. I'd like to add support for other databases such as sqlite,
duckdb, and posgresql, but those aren't ones I use on a daily basis so they're
lower priority at the moment.

Code is provided as is. This is a tool for me and my workflow. If it helps or
inspires you, that's great. If it doesn't work for you, you can fork the repo.
You can make a PR and I'll look at it, but I reserve the right to reject for
any reason.
